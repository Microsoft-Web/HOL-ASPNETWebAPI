  <Description>In recent years, it has become clear that HTTP is not just for serving up HTML pages. It is also a powerful platform for building Web APIs, using a handful of verbs (GET, POST, and so forth) plus a few simple concepts such as URIs and headers. WCF Web API is a set of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) components that simplify HTTP programming. Because it is built on WCF, Web API automatically handles the low-level transport details of HTTP, exposing the HTTP programming model in a natural, flexible and extensible way. In this hands-on lab, you will use the WCF Web API to build a simple REST API for a contact manager application. You will also build a client to consume the API. No prior knowledge of WCF is assumed.</Description>
